# Mardown Previewer

SPA developed with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) using [VueCLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/).

Simple markdown previewer, converting it to HTML. Useful for creating README files for GitHub. Markdown is a simple text format whose goal is to be very easy to read and write, even when not converted to HTML.

## Libraries

* For styling I used [Inkline](https://www.inkline.io) along with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) using [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax).
* For converting Markdown into HTML, [Marked](marked.js.org) was used.
